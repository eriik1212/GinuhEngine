# Ginuh Engine
## About Engine
Ginuh engine is a 3d videogame development engine created by two students at [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/). This project was made as part of a subject assignement. With our engine you can create, eliminate, modify and parent GameObjects, you can change textures, charge and play audios and import meshes.
